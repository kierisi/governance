# Branding

## The pyOpenSci brand

The pyOpenSci brand is playful, curious, and integrates a calm color palette with illustrations and abstract primary shapes that are soft, round, and flowing. We also have a publicly available [Google Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1glwf3BEPxo5H6pOHp6d55r2sbw8x-8kQZ9GzoLXwEDc/edit?usp=sharing) with access to all of our logos and brand information.

If you have any additional questions about the pyOpenSci brand, please email [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org).

## The pyOpenSci brand: diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
pyOpenSci recruits and supports editors and reviewers from different backgrounds and gender-identities in each review that we perform.  

**To break this down into concrete actions:**
* We actively recruit individuals from underrepresented backgrounds
* We support people through individualized mentorship
* When possible, we elevate people into leadership roles
