# External Communications

pyOpenSci uses a multitude of platforms for external communication, in order to both maintain communication with our current community, as well as grow our community. Our external communications fall under the broad categories of email, the pyOpenSci blog, pyOpenSci newsletters, and social media platforms. This section details each of those broad categories, as well as the specific platforms used within each, and provides relevant links and insights into the purpose, strategy, and associated processes for each platform.  

## Email
pyOpenSci does not send unsolicited bulk emails, and all emails contain an unsubscribe link. Emails from pyOpenSci are sent to communicate with potential volunteers, share the monthly version of the newsletter, and to keep registered event participants up-to-date on logistics. pyOpenSci will also reach out to event attendees with pre- and/or post-surveys, along with follow-up reminders, as needed.

### Mailchimp

pyOpenSci uses [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) as a catch-all bulk emailing service. Anyone interested in subscribing to the pyOpenSci mailing list and receiving our monthly newsletter can do so by [signing up here](https://eepurl.com/iM7SOM). We also use Mailchimp to communicate with individuals who have signed up to volunteer as a [reviewer](https://forms.gle/Mps4UsRHTyF66cdg7) and/or [editor](https://forms.gle/aFAMBjrdU7f7zMP89) as part of our [open software peer review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html).

### EventBrite

pyOpenSci uses [EventBrite](https://eventbrite.com) to manage event sign-ups. Anyone who has registered for a pyOpenSci event through EventBrite will be contacted through the EventBrite service regarding event updates and logistics. pyOpenSci may also upload EventBrite contacts to Mailchimp or SurveyMonkey for the purposes of sending out pre- and/or post-surveys.

### SurveyMonkey

[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) is used to send out pre- and/or post-surveys to attendees of pyOpenSci events. This can include in-person or online events such as workshops, talks, and sprints. SurveyMonkey is used due to its ease of use, integration with HubSpot, and ability to send out survey reminder emails.

### HubSpot

[HubSpot](https://hubspot.com/) is pyOpenSci's customer relationship management (CRM) platform. Although HubSpot has email capabilities, pyOpenSci does not currently use this functionality.
