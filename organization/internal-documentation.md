# Internal documentation

Google Drive is currently where all pyOpenSci documentation is stored, and where different types of documentation are stored within Google Drive is important.

Documentation related to pyOpenSci in any way, including branding, event planning, lesson development, talks, etc. should be stored in the `pyos-shared` shared drive. This ensures that all pyOpenSci employees are able to access, edit, and use these documents.

Personal documents such as 1-on-1 agendas, personal notes, and other information that does not need to be shared at the organizational level can always be in the employee personal drive.
