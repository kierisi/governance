# pyOpenSci uses Canva as a shared graphic platform
pyOpenSci has a Pro subscription to [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), and uses the platform for:
* Asset creation
* Diagramming
* Creative strategy work

pyOpenSci is currently collaborating with a graphic designer to finalize branding assets, but in the interim, the current brand template in Canva should be used for both color palettes and font choices. Because branding has not yet been finalized, any new designs should first be approved by the Executive Director and Founder, Leah Wasser, before going live. This includes both internal and external communications.

In addition, all assets should be shared with the pyOpenSci team within Canva. This is accomplished by clicking “Share” in the top right of the screen, then selecting the pyopensci-canva-team and “Can edit” from beneath the collaboration link header.

Once assets are approved and shared, they should also be stored in the appropriate Project folder (and subfolders, where appropriate) on Canva. Where needed, please create additional folders in order to keep assets organized and easy to find. When there are questions about folder organization and naming, please reach out to the pyOpenSci Executive Director and Founder, Leah Wasser, for clarification.
